# TREX
A TeRminal based file EXplorer.

# Normal mode (default mode)
- in this mode you can't type anything
- can use only arrow keys and enter key

> NOTE:type ':' in normal mode to switch to command mode

# Command mode 
- where you can enter specific commands

# doubts
 - pressing ESC key application should go back to normal mode 
 (conflicts with the handling of Arrow Keys)
  An arrow key is a combination of 'ESC','[' and 'A(for up arrow)')
